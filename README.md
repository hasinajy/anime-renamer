# Anime File Renamer

A Python script (and standalone `.exe`) to rename anime files with custom delimiters and advanced formatting. This tool is designed to clean up and organize anime filenames by adding season numbers, episode numbers, and removing unwanted tags like `(Dub)` or `[Subbed]`.

---

## Features

- **Custom Delimiters**: Remove unwanted parts of filenames (e.g., `(Dub)`, `[Subbed]`).
- **Season Support**: Add season numbers to filenames (e.g., `S01`, `S02`).
- **Episode Numbering**: Start episode numbering from a specified value.
- **Batch Processing**: Rename all files in a directory that match the expected format.
- **Standalone Executable**: No Python installation required!

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- **For the Python script**: Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **For the `.exe` file**: No prerequisites needed. Just download and run!

     5. Click **OK** to save changes.
   - Now, you can run the tool from any directory:
